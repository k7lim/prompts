1. Open **@prompt_plan.md** and identify any prompts not marked as completed.
2. For each incomplete prompt:
    - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
    - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
    - Otherwise, implement it as described.
    - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
    - Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
    - Update **@prompt_plan.md** to mark this prompt as completed.
3. After you can finish each prompt, proceed unless there's a specific reason or call to wait for human review/feedback.
4. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.
