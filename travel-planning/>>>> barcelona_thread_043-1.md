Thanks!!Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShareTabathaAug 1, 2023Liked by Blackbird SpyplaneJust got back from 3 days in Barcelona - what a city!My recommendations in addition to what's already been said:To drink and eat:Dr Stravinsky was the absolute coolest cocktail bar I've ever been to. Incredible staff and truly mind-blowing drinks (the Tuber Negroni was incredible)Xerta - fine dining in a relaxed atmosphere with incredibly friendly staff. The kitchen can be seen from the dining area, but they must be the calmest, most softly-spoken kitchen because we didn't hear a sound. The meal truly was an experience and I think might have been the best in my life.Tapeo - incredible tapas. Don't sleep on the sea bass ceviche or the fried anchovies.Bar Brutal - wine bar with excellent tapas. Our server was absolutely lovely and took lots of time with my cousins. I would have stayed longer to have a few more drinks if we hadn't been with family!To do:Casa Batllo - a house redesigned by Gaudi in a ritzy area of Barcelona. If you like architecture and design, this is not one to miss. It was busy with other tourists, but it's so beautiful I was close to tears on a couple of occasions.Shopping:If you're a purchaser of fabrics, you can't miss Nunoya or Teles Julián López (they share a building, but are two different shops). My little mind was blown with the choice of fabrics.Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShareBlackbird SpyplaneMay 16, 2023AuthorSpyFriend ELK says:Just got back from a week in Barca so I feel qualified to write stuffFOOD: Pretty much everything already written here is correct.

If you have a chance to take a road trip down the Wild Atlantic Way, take it! Some of my favourite gems along the WAW:- Swimming at Carrickfinn Beach is a delight and the airport apparently has the most scenic take-off and landing in the world.- Achill Island is absolutely beautiful and well worth a visit. Lots of scenes in the Banshees of Inisherin were filmed there. And if creepy abandoned villages are your thing, there's one on the island. - There's lots of great seafood along this coastline, but the best meal I had on this particular trip was at the Fish and Bean, a cafe and restaurant at the Sligo Yacht Club. "Yacht club" makes it sound fancy, but it's really not. Just good vibes and incredible seafood.- My second-favourite meal was at Kai, in Galway. Beautifully-presented, seasonal foods in an eclectic space.Not on the west coast of Ireland, but if you find yourself in Derry, get yourself to Storefront ( https://storefrontni.com/ ). They have a mixture of new and vintage (mainly menswear and unisex).And if it takes any bartender less than 3 minutes to pour your Guinness, they aren't doing it right.

I also like Long Teng II spa for a standard, inexpensive massage.East Village: Au Za'atar (they bring you your own miniature shwarma spit), Librae Bakery, SOS Chefs, Wu's Wonton King, Cafe Lyria, Russian & Turkish Bath House (ask for Sasha), Funny Face Bakery, Souen, Divya's Kitchen. I've heard East Village Acupuncture & Massage is good. The west village: Bar Pisellino.Brooklyn: Quimby's for books, Ras for Ethiopian, Mia's for cake, Pies'n'Thighs for banana cream pie, Bakeri for breakfast (I think this was recommended here on BBSP!), Dar525 for Mediterranean, Al Di La for Italian. There are a row of home good stores (Assembly Line, Collier West) near the transit museum that are cool. The aquatic plants room at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens can cure your SAD. And I've heard Fiction Bar, Black Spring Books, L'Industrie, and F&F are great. Queens: Go to Jackson Heights, go to all of the neighborhoods and eat authentic Greek or Brazilian or Balkan food or whatever.

If you like a pool with your hotel , Hotel Molitor is a great option. Especially if you want to get out of the hectic inner city. Good rooftop vibes here as well. PARIS record stores i like: There are plenty of record stores in Paris. Most are located towards the Marais.

Standing only, but great vibes, mostly locals, excellent food and wine at a good price.- Giclette – Similar vibe, wine cave in Bastille with awesome food. Unpretentious and local vibe.- Cafe du Coin – Corner cafe with excellent drinks, mini pizzas, etc. Again, local feel, casual, cool.- Bleu de Cocagne – stumbled upon this shop and what a find. Primo materials, made in small batches with care. I got a moleskine jacket and my wife got a heavyweight cotton sweatshirt. Both could have easily been 3x the price and quality is BIFL.- See Fan – Tiny little upcycled shop that we also stumbled upon, with seemingly very in-the-know clientele and a cool aesthetic, again relatively affordable.- Bleu de Paname – IMO the modern chore/utility coat kings.- Parages - local brand.

I always find cool stuff here and it's usually really affordable. There's lots of cute shopping down 4th St (if you start at South St and walk south on 4th) Yowie for home goods is hyped but worth a visit, she's involved in a lot of cool collabs/projects, like a boutique hotel called The Deacon and another one coming soon called Wim. Philly Vintage Bazaar. Moon + Arrow if you want to feel like a cool groovy mom who has transcended the atmosphere to live in clouds made of ethically sourced linen robes. Brickbat is a good used bookstore.Reading Terminal is of course touristy but worth it anyway. Hungover in the morning? Stuffed pretzel breakfast roll from Miller's Twist. Wanna try something new? Cheese boat from Saami Soomi. DiNics is good, yes. Philly is a sandwich town. The line is usually shorter at Herschel's and their Reubens SLAP. Termini Bros has other locations but the RTM one is convenient and boy you gotta try a cannoli there man I'm telling you. If its somebody's bday get em a lil tiramisu.Natty wine: -Bloomsday - cafe vibes but serve dinner and have lots of cool bottles for sale to go; don't pay attention when they say "East Philly" on their instagram, they're trying to make it a thing but it's not a thing-Le Caveau - located above Good King which serves really solid French food-Beddia mentioned above always has a great wine list which is why I go there to eat pizza-Fishtown Social, all about the wine-Wilder - great all-around restaurant and funky decor I love it here. Pizza, pasta, veggie shareables, raw bar, 5-6 larger entrees, always great wine and beer list-Vedge - incredible and inventive vegan food, beautiful bar in the Gayborhood-DiBruno Bros is a meat/cheese/etc market with lots of bottles for sale. Def pricier than if you were to buy at a larger store in Jersey or something.-Lunar Inn is a cute spot with great food and wine, it's just off the beaten path for most people. Their bottle shop is called Tiny's. I'd go for a quiet brunch. Check out some of the other storefronts on Richmond Ave while you're there.There are tons of really great BYOBs in Philly, which is pretty unusual. This can be a great way to spend a little less on a nice dinner than you usually would. Just make sure you bring some wine or beer if you want to compliment your meal.Bok Bar is sick views and fun programming. Only open during warmer months.Expand full commentLike (3)Reply (1)ShareMaryOct 18, 2022Liked by Blackbird SpyplaneAlso if you're into history/architecture, the Free Library's main branch is a beautiful Beaux-Arts building and they give free tours every weekday at 2pm. The Rosenbach Museum is a library partner; if you're into rare books, it's a really cool gem in a v nice area with lots of old houses. Home to a lot of the Ulysses manuscript. They do a big thing on Bloomsday every year. Weirdos love the Mutter Museum.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare© 2025 Blackbird Spyplane Inc.Privacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice Start writingGet the appSubstack is the home for great cultureShareCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreUpdate your profileName*HandleBioSave & Post CommentHi blackbird@cokacokacoh.comOnly paid subscribers can comment on this postAlready a paid subscriber?
