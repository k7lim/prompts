# prompt clipboard idea

an intelligent prompt management application designed to automatically monitor the clipboard, utilize local Large Language Model (LLM) intelligence for prompt identification and organization, and support advanced features such as versioning and iteration.

Architecture:

User Interface (UI): Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) along with a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) are used to build the UI. Tauri renders this UI within an OS-native WebView (WebKit on macOS/Linux, WebView2 on Windows).  

Backend Logic (Core): Written entirely in Rust. The Rust backend handles all core application logic: clipboard interactions, LLM processing, database operations (CRUD, vector search), and prompt versioning.

Clipboard Monitoring: The Tauri clipboard-manager plugin provides cross-platform APIs for reading from and writing to the clipboard, accessible from both Rust and JavaScript. Permissions are managed through Tauri's capabilities system.  

Local LLM Integration: Rust has excellent support for integrating C/C++ libraries. Llama.cpp can be used via Rust bindings (e.g., the llama-cpp-rs crate). Alternatively, the Rust backend could communicate with a locally running Ollama instance via its API, treating Ollama as a separate service.  

Database: SQLite is accessed using the rusqlite crate in Rust. The   

sqlite-vss extension also has Rust bindings, allowing for direct integration of vector search capabilities into the Rust backend.  

Versioning Logic: Diffing can be performed using Rust libraries (e.g., similar), and the version history (snapshots or diffs) stored in the SQLite database managed by Rust.

Communication (UI-Backend): The web-based UI communicates with the Rust backend through Tauri's command and event system, which provides an efficient Inter-Process Communication (IPC) bridge.  

Component Choices:

Framework: Tauri

UI: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React or Vue)

Backend: Rust

Clipboard: Tauri clipboard-manager plugin

LLM: Llama.cpp (via Rust bindings) or Ollama (as a service)

Database: SQLite (via rusqlite) + sqlite-vss (via Rust bindings)

Diffing: Rust library (e.g., similar)
